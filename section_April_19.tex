[Moving some old notes here.]

\textbf{Our ambitions, micro-summary/brainstorm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Be a knowledge capital competitor/collaborator/frenemie with Wikipedia, somewhat \`a la StackExchange
\item Resolve somehow the questions we have hanging around about how/whether to make money with this project 
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Some current problems, micro-summary/brainstorm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Newcomers with new ideas that are different from our ideas -- this is actually kind of cool but it takes work and can be a bit stressful
\item Handbook v3 has to be finished and seems to be hanging on by a thread
\item Handbook v4 has no process defined really at all -- hopefully becomes all github pages
\item Some relatively minor technical issues need to be resolved, and we have to decide what platform to use
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Some precedents and hopes, micro-summary/brainstorm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is similar to \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZEsqFDwF-jPiCvgWzJgi6n6faTRTDuPQS1CMEeXxRE/edit#heading=h.p197njr3jsn8}{our old Accelerator doc}, where we had a bunch of deadlines and ideas recorded and that was really useful 
\item It can create a shared memory that persists and is not too sloppy
\end{enumerate}
