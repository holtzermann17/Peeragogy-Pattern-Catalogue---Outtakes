\item April 17 - submit a version of that to Open Ed âœ“
\item April 19\textsuperscript{th}: Decide whether we want to open the authorship up to include other Peeragogy people at the current time, or later.

\item Is it useful for realizing our ambitions??
\item Is this document actually useful for managing our ``tasks''?
